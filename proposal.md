Project Proposal (Pet Task Manager?)
Our team would like to create an application that helps users keep themselves accountable with the use of a virtual pet.
For example, we want to help users wake up on time. Therefore we have them set an alarm for themselves, and if they wake up in time, their pet becomes rewarded. For their pet to progress in the application or have more gifts, the user has to keep themselves on task.

-We are tinkering with what need we want our application to answer. A time sensitive tool is our start.
-We want the pet to be a fun and interactive game part to retain the user.
