## Project Proposal (Pet Task Manager?)

Our team would like to create an application that helps users keep themselves accountable with the use of a virtual pet for motivation.
For example, we want to help users wake up on time. Therefore, we have them set an alarm for themselves and have the app reward their pet if they wake up on time. For their pet to progress within the application or have more gifts, the user has to keep themselves on task consistently.

- We are tinkering with what need we want our application to answer. A time sensitive tool is our start.

- We want the pet to be a fun and interactive game part to retain the user.
