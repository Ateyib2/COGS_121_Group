# Milestone 6

## Improvements
We have changed the background image, and changed different icons. The user profile info now automatically loads when the user connects to the Fitbit API.

## Data Visualization
Our user's Fitbit data is displayed to the user in a table format, and their step data is displayed in a line graph using the c3.js library. The step data is from the past week.
