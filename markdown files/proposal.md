## Project Proposal (Pet Task Manager?)

Our team would like to create an application that helps users keep themselves accountable with the use of a virtual pet for motivation.
For example, we could help users wake up on time. Then, we would have them set an alarm for themselves and have the app reward their pet if they wake up on time. For their pet to progress within the application and attain more gifts, the user has to keep themselves on task consistently.

- We are tinkering with what need we want our application to fulfill. A time sensitive tool is our start.

- We want the pet to be fun and interactive to retain the user.

- We want the app to obtain relevant user data that will help the user become more accountable over time.
